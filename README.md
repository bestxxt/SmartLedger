## ⭐ Key Features 
- 🛡️ **Self-hosted** 
Deploy Smart Ledger on your own server or machine. Your financial data remains **fully under your control**  — no third-party storage, no data tracking. Seamlessly **sync across devices**  to keep your records accessible and consistent.

- 🎙️ **Voice Input** 
Record spoken expense entries. Powered by **Whisper**  for speech recognition and integrated with an **LLM**  for context understanding, Smart Ledger can convert your voice into clean, structured financial transactions with ease.

- 📷 **Picture Input** 
Snap photos of receipts or bills. Smart Ledger uses **multi-LLM models** to automatically extract key financial details like amount, date, and category — no manual typing required.

- 💻 **Beautiful User Interface** 
Enjoy a modern, mobile-friendly UI built with **Next.js**. Designed for simplicity and speed. Can be added to your home screen and run in **fullscreen like a native app**  on iOS/macOS — no need to go through the App Store. Just open in Safari and "Add to Home Screen."


- 💱 **Multi-Currency Support** 
Automatically detects and converts multiple currencies from input (voice, image, or text) — perfect for international usage or travel expense tracking.
 

- 🏷️ **Tagging & Categorization** 
Add your own custom tags or let the AI suggest and infer tags based on transaction content. Smart Ledger helps keep your records organized effortlessly.

- 🔒 **Full Privacy & Control** 
All components are **open-source and self-manageable** . No vendor lock-in, no hidden data sharing — just transparent software that puts you in charge.


## 🛣️ Planned Direction

The following changes are planned for future development:

1. **Frontend-first storage, optional backend**
   - Remove the hard dependency on MongoDB. The app will become **frontend-first**: data is stored in a **frontend/local database** (e.g. IndexedDB or similar) by default.
   - **Backend sync is optional**: users can optionally sync data to a server for backup or cross-device use. When used, the backend can still use MongoDB (or another database) for persistence.

2. **Separate UIs for desktop and mobile**
   - **Mobile**: use [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) for a native-feel mobile UI.
   - **Desktop**: framework for the desktop UI is not yet decided (TBD).


## 🚀 Quickstart 

### 🗣️ Install Whisper Transcription Server (Required)
Smart Ledger uses a separate FastAPI-based Whisper server (powered by faster-whisper) to handle speech-to-text transcription.

**Requirements**

- 3.8 < Python < 3.12
 
- `ffmpeg` installed (for `pydub` to work)
 
- A machine with CPU or CUDA-compatible GPU

**Install dependencies**

Go to `/whisper`
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Prepare environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root of the whisper server directory.


```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Run the server**



```bash
python whisper_server.py
```

Or with `uvicorn`:


```bash
uvicorn whisper_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

If you want to use cuda: install cuDNN at https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads

### ☁️ Run in Vercel
1. Import the GitHub repo into Vercel
2. Configure Environment Variables 
In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project's Settings > Environment Variables and add the following (based on .env.example)

| Key                     | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MONGODB_URI`           | Your MongoDB connection string.                         |
| `MONGODB_DB`            | The database name                                       |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`          | Your Vercel domain (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`) |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`       | A random secret string                                  |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`        | Your Gemini API key                                     |
| `GEMINI_MODEL`          | e.g. `gemini-2.0-flash`                                 |
| `INVITE_CODE`           | Invite code, used for register                 |
| `TRANSCRIPTION_URL`     | Your Whisper server URL                                 |
| `TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY` | Your Whisper service                                    |
| `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` | Currency exchange API key                               |

### 💻 Run In Your sever 
1. **Clone the repository** 


```bash
git clone https://github.com/bestxxt/SmartLedger.git
cd smart-ledger
```
 
2. **Install dependencies** 


```bash
npm install
```
 
3. **Set up environment variables** 
Copy `.env.example` and rename it:


```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```


Then fill in the required values like **MongoDB URI, API keys, etc**.
 
4. **Run the app in development** 


```bash
npm run dev
```

### **(Optional) Run in background using PM2** 
[PM2]()  is a production-grade process manager for Node.js applications. It keeps your app running in the background, automatically restarts it on crash or reboot, and makes it easy to manage logs and processes.

**Install PM2 globally**


```bash
npm install -g pm2
```


**Build the Next.js app (if not already done)**

If you're deploying the production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Start the app with PM2**

```bash
pm2 start "npm run start" --name smart-ledger
```

 
- `npm run start` starts your Next.js app in production mode.
 
- `--name smart-ledger` assigns a name to your process for easy management.


**Save the PM2 process list**


This ensures your app will restart automatically on system reboot.



```bash
pm2 save
```


**🔁 (Optional) Set up PM2 to start on boot**



```bash
pm2 startup
```

Follow the printed instructions (it will give you a command to run, e.g. `sudo env PATH=... pm2 startup systemd -u youruser --hp /home/youruser`).

**Monitor or manage the process**

```bash
pm2 list              # View all running apps
pm2 logs smart-ledger # View logs for your app
pm2 restart smart-ledger # Restart the app
pm2 stop smart-ledger    # Stop the app
```

## 🎬 Demo Videos 


### 🎙️ Voice Input Demo (Multiple Expenses + Income) 

This video demonstrates Smart Ledger's ability to process natural voice input and generate multiple transactions — including both **expenses**  and **income**  — in a single sentence.

> I said: I had lunch with colleagues at a Korean restaurant, spent 28 dollars.
> On my way home I stopped to get gas, paid 40 dollars.
> Also, I received my salary today — 8000 dollars just landed in my account.”
